<h4> Hello team! </h4>

  I've created this Github repository to showcase my analytics work on the Olist Marketplace data. Olist is an online e-commerce platform that connects merchants and their products to the main marketplaces of Brazil. The site allows shopkeepers of all sizes to register for their products to be sold at the olist store, along with Brazil’s top retailers, using olist’s platform and logistics set-up.
  
  Olist is facing challenges critical to maintaining maximum revenue and in finding new sellers to start selling products on their site.  Olist wants to make sure that their Sales Development Representatives are using their time to maximise the money both the sellers and olist make. This means, which sellers are most likely to convert, and which sellers are most likely to make the most money with. Olist also needs help in identifying ways to achieve maximum return on both during the marketing process and afterwards.

  To help provide insights and recommendations on what steps they should take in addressing these challenges, I have used Python, SQLite and Tableau for comprehensive analysis and combined them for easy understanding here. 
  
  Please click on the .ipynb and the .sql files to see all the coding and analysis stuff. The associated Tableau Dashboards are linked here, and with this you can see some of the key data insights I brought forward for this project.
