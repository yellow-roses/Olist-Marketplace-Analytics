<h4> Hello team! </h4>

  I've created this Github repository to showcase my analytics work on the Olist Marketplace data. 
  I have used Python, SQLite and Tableau for comprehensive analysis and combined them here. Please click on the .ipynb and the .sql files to see all the coding and analysis stuff. The associated Tableau Dashboards are linked here, and with this you can see all the data insights I brought forward for this project.
